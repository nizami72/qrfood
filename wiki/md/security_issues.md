# Security Analysis Report

This document outlines the security analysis of the qrfood project, focusing on potential threats to data integrity when accessing REST services.

## 1. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

**Risk:** High

**Description:** Several endpoints use object IDs in the URL path (e.g., `/api/eatery/{eateryId}/category/{categoryId}`). The application uses `@PreAuthorize` annotations for authorization, but it's unclear if the logic verifies that the authenticated user has ownership of the requested resource. This could allow an authenticated user to access or modify data belonging to other users by manipulating the ID in the URL.

**Example:** An `EATERY_ADMIN` of eatery `A` might be able to access or modify categories of eatery `B` by changing the `eateryId` in the URL.

**Recommendation:** Strengthen the authorization logic to ensure that it checks not only the user's role but also their ownership of the requested resource. For instance, before allowing a user to modify a category, verify that the category belongs to an eatery that the user owns or manages.

## 2. Insufficient Input Validation

**Risk:** Medium

**Description:** The application lacks consistent input validation across its controllers. While it uses DTOs, there is no evidence of a validation framework like Hibernate Validator being used to sanitize and validate all incoming data. This could expose the application to various attacks, including injection attacks and unexpected application behavior.

**Example:** In the `FrontendLogController`, the `logDTO` is taken from the request body and logged without any apparent validation, which could lead to log injection if a malicious payload is sent.

**Recommendation:** Implement a robust input validation mechanism. Use a library like Hibernate Validator and apply the `@Valid` annotation to all DTOs in the controller methods to ensure that all incoming data is validated against a set of predefined rules.

## 3. Lack of Principle of Least Privilege

**Risk:** Medium

**Description:** The `@PreAuthorize` annotations often grant access to multiple roles (e.g., `'EATERY_ADMIN', 'KITCHEN_ADMIN', 'WAITER', 'CASHIER'`). This approach may grant more permissions than necessary for certain roles, violating the principle of least privilege.

**Example:** A `WAITER` may not need access to all categories of an eatery, but the current authorization scheme might allow it.

**Recommendation:** Review the roles and their permissions to ensure that each role has only the minimum necessary permissions to perform its functions. Create more granular roles if needed.

## 4. Insecure File Uploads

**Risk:** Medium

**Description:** The `CategoryController` and `DishController` handle file uploads. Without proper validation of file types, sizes, and content, this could be a vector for various attacks, such as storing malicious files on the server, which could lead to remote code execution.

**Recommendation:** Implement strict validation for file uploads. Check file extensions, MIME types, and file sizes. Consider using a virus scanner to check uploaded files for malware.

## 5. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Risk:** Low

**Description:** The application uses JWT for authentication, which is generally stateless and less susceptible to traditional CSRF attacks. However, if the JWT is stored in a cookie without the `HttpOnly` and `SameSite` flags, it could still be vulnerable.

**Recommendation:** If JWTs are stored in cookies, ensure that the `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Strict` flags are set to prevent the browser from sending the cookie with cross-site requests.

## 6. Impersonation Feature

**Risk:** High

**Description:** The `AdminController` has an `impersonateUser` endpoint that allows a `SUPER_ADMIN` to log in on behalf of another user. While this is a powerful feature, it's also a high-risk one. If not properly secured, it could be abused to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Recommendation:** Ensure that the `impersonateUser` endpoint is restricted to a very limited set of trusted super administrators. Log all impersonation attempts and consider adding a notification to the impersonated user to alert them of the action.

## 7. Dependency Vulnerabilities

**Risk:** Medium

**Description:** The `pom.xml` file lists several dependencies, some of which may have known vulnerabilities. For example, `mysql-connector-java:8.0.33` may have known security issues.

**Recommendation:** Use a dependency scanning tool like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies. Keep dependencies up-to-date and regularly scan for new vulnerabilities.

## 8. Insecure Error Handling

**Risk:** Low

**Description:** The error handling in some controllers could potentially leak sensitive information. For example, in the `DishController`, the `getDishOrThrow` method throws an `EntityNotFoundException` with a detailed message that could reveal information about the application's structure to an attacker.

**Recommendation:** Configure the application to return generic error messages in production environments to avoid leaking sensitive information. Detailed error messages should only be enabled in development and testing environments.
